                            Of course you can. Everything is negotiable. But be respectful and understanding that everyone has a business to run and livelihood to make. Most vendors are quoting well thought prices that correctly match the quality and quantity of service you desire for your job.

                            We strongly recommend that you do. If you are contacted directly outside our system, we encourage you to have them go back to Posluga.ua to send you an official quote or you can get a quote from provider's profile. Bookings that are not done on Posluga.ua are not eligible for dispute resolution, secure payments, verified reviews, or booking protection.

                            This is very uncommon but unforeseen issues can arise. This is one reason we encourage that all bookings happen on Posluga.ua. If you book the service through our site and the provider does not show up, we can ensure that we will find another provider to cover the service as soon as possible.

                            You can cancel the booking before the event date. But if you want to cancel the booking after the event date then the provider still has to pay us commission from the total price as if the service has been given. So in order to not make the provider mistreated; you must talk with the provider to decide on another date, another service or any other form of dispute resolution.

                            The vast majority of requests on Posluga.ua are from honest people because we use mobile phone verification. However, as it is with most websites, bad apples can attempt from time to time. Use extra caution when dealing with requests which contain any of the following. A simple test is to call the phone number. If it’s a generic answering system, a disconnected number, or a wrong number be cautious. Please contact us if you are unsure about the validity of a request.

                            It’s pretty simple actually. When you receive a lead you’re interested in, just respond by sending a quote back. We’ll send that over to the client and if they like what they see, they’ll accept your quote. Then it’s booked! All that’s left is for you to show up and do your thing.

                                Are there commissions or finder’s fees to pay when I am booked through Posluga.ua?

                            There is a service fee of 10% that is charged when a service is booked. This fee covers our costs associated with development and maintenance of the system.

                            Quotes can be updated or cancelled until the lead closes for bidding or until client accepts your quote. If the client has selected your quote and the service is booked then you cannot update or cancel.

                            If you cancel a booking prior to the event date, you will be responsible for covering the Posluga.ua service fee. If you fail to appear at the event for which you have been booked, you will be responsible for covering the Posluga.ua service fee and your membership may be terminated.

                            Allowing you to post a review yourself would render the rating illegitimate, so we do not allow this. Please invite these clients to posluga.ua to get quotes from you so they can write about their past experiences.

                            We verify reviews whether they are not obscene, abusive, or fraudulent. I that's the case we don't show them up on your profile.
